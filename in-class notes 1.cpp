4/3/25 In-Class Notes
Veronica Martinez

one of the most important parts about writing code is making comments for organization purposes
    - it makes the program more legible for others
    - it explains what the code does & why
    - in this class we want to write as FEW comments as possible
        - only write comments where people might misunderstand your program
            - if it takes you a long time to do, and you're proud of it, add a comment explaining it
        - if you use a number in the code, EXPLAIN WHERE THE NUMBER COMES FROM
code must compile on ALL machines
code must do what it is supposed to do
we must test to confirm and prove that the code works
code must be efficient
efficiency, readability, function, testing
use whichever C++ style you want (for variable names, etc.), but use it everywhere
    - be consistent

Git & GitHub lets us keep track of changes and manage them
    - you have a way to store a snapshot of your code before making a change
        - a snapshot/version is called a "commit"
            - you can write text so you can explain what changes in each commit
        - a branch is another copy of your folder
    - Git & GitHub also lets you easily collaborate with others
Git & GitHub terms
    - repository or "repo" is a folder
    - commit is a snapshot of the repo at a certain time
    - branch is a line of development, made up of a series of commits

connect to GitHub
commit
send to GitHub
commit each change

    - make sure to comment where the numbers come from
